# LEGO/STEM Club Challenge Tracker

## Project Overview
The LEGO/STEM Club Challenge Tracker is a database project designed to track children’s participation in LEGO and STEM kit builds, as well as club challenges. It allows tracking of:

- Which children completed which kits
- Completion dates and time taken
- Challenge participation and scores
- Overall performance metrics and summaries

This project demonstrates skills in **SQL, database design, data retrieval, aggregation, views, and functions**. It’s built in **MySQL** and visualized using **DBeaver**.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following **SQL and data analytics skills**:

- **Database Design & Management**  
  - Created relational tables with primary and foreign keys  
  - Defined relationships between children, kits, builds, and challenges  

- **Data Retrieval & Querying**  
  - SELECT statements with filtering (`WHERE`) and sorting (`ORDER BY`)  
  - Joins to combine data across multiple tables  
  - Aggregations using `GROUP BY` and functions like `AVG`, `COUNT`  

- **Data Organization & Optimization**  
  - Created **views** to simplify complex queries  
  - Used **functions / stored procedures** for reusable calculations  

- **Data Integrity & Cleaning**  
  - Handled duplicate entries  
  - Ensured consistent data types and relationships across tables  

- **Tool Usage**  
  - **MySQL** for database creation and management  
  - **DBeaver** for visualizing tables, ERD diagrams, and running queries  

This section demonstrates how I applied the SQL knowledge gained through my learning journey to build a **real-world, child-focused database project**.
